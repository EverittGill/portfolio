              I am a tech-enthusiast and Full Stack Web Developer with a unique blend of interpersonal and technological skills. As a graduate of the Georgia Institute of Technology's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, I took pride in developing "Market Dash," an AI-powered marketing tool tailored for independent farmers market vendors. Proficient in MERN, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and with a strong grasp on Real Estate and Ethereum, I'm passionate about crafting technology solutions centered around user needs. While my professional journey initiated as a Realtor, marked by roles within my own enterprise Everitt Gill Real Estate and the real estate technology firm, Redfin, Iâ€™m now dedicated to the tech industry, particularly in using my skills to simplify user experiences. Outside of coding, my passions include cooking, traveling, ceramics, writing, and exercising.
